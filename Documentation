5. System Design
Database Schema
The database has tables to store the following information:

Users Table: Stores user data such as name, email, password, age, and blood type.
Donation Centers Table: Stores information about blood donation centers like name, location, and available slots.
Donation History Table: Records details about the blood donations made by users.
Servlet Flow
RegisterServlet:

Handles user registration by receiving data from the registration form, validating it, and storing it in the database.
LoginServlet:

Manages user login by verifying the email and password against the stored records.
ProfileServlet:

Displays and updates the user’s profile information, including their donation history.
6. How to Run the Project
Steps to Run the Application:
Clone the repository from GitHub (if applicable).
Build the project using Maven by running the following command in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Deploy the generated WAR file to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat.
Start the server and access the application at:
bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/blood-donation-management
7. Unit Testing
Unit tests for the service and DAO layers are implemented using JUnit and Mockito. These tests ensure that the database interactions and business logic are functioning correctly.

DAO Layer Tests: Test the methods in DAO classes to ensure that they interact correctly with the database.
Service Layer Tests: Test the service layer to ensure that it processes data correctly before passing it to the DAO.
8. Future Enhancements
Security Enhancements:

Implement password hashing to secure user passwords.
Email Notifications:

Add functionality to send email notifications for successful registration, appointment scheduling, and donation reminders.
Mobile App Integration:

Provide a REST API for integrating the system with mobile applications.
Admin Dashboard Improvements:

Implement advanced reporting and analytics features for donation tracking.
9. Conclusion
The Blood Donation Management System is a feature-rich application that helps users easily register as blood donors, schedule donations, and view donation centers. Admins can manage donor records and track donations. With its user-friendly interface and reliable backend, the system can be extended further to include additional features such as notifications, improved security, and mobile app integration.
